# 🎵 Audio Setup Instructions

## ✅ What I've Done:

1. **Created Audio Directory**: `public/audio/` folder is ready
2. **Updated Code**: Meditation component now uses local audio files
3. **Created Setup Script**: `setup-audio.js` to help verify your files
4. **Added Documentation**: `public/audio/README.md` with detailed instructions

## 🎯 Next Steps for You:

### Step 1: Download Your Audio Files
- Download the mindfulness music from the YouTube video you shared
- Convert to MP3 format if needed
- Download or find audio for the other meditation types:
  - Breathing meditation (ocean waves, nature sounds)
  - Body scan meditation (gentle rain, ambient sounds)
  - Loving kindness meditation (soft chimes, peaceful music)

### Step 2: Rename and Place Files
Place your audio files in `public/audio/` with these exact names:
```
public/audio/
├── mindfulness-music.mp3      ← Your YouTube video audio
├── breathing-music.mp3        ← Ocean waves or nature sounds
├── body-scan-music.mp3        ← Gentle rain or ambient sounds
└── loving-kindness-music.mp3  ← Soft chimes or peaceful music
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
Run the setup script to check if everything is working:
```bash
node setup-audio.js
```

## 🎵 File Requirements:

- **Format**: MP3 (recommended) or WAV
- **Duration**: 10-60 minutes (will loop automatically)
- **Quality**: 128kbps or higher
- **Size**: Keep under 10MB per file for best performance

## 🔧 How It Works:

The meditation app will now look for audio files in the `public/audio/` folder. When you start a meditation session:

1. **Mindfulness**: Plays `mindfulness-music.mp3`
2. **Breathing**: Plays `breathing-music.mp3`
3. **Body Scan**: Plays `body-scan-music.mp3`
4. **Loving Kindness**: Plays `loving-kindness-music.mp3`

## 🚀 Benefits of Local Audio:

- ✅ **Faster Loading**: No network delays
- ✅ **Reliable**: Always available offline
- ✅ **Custom**: Your preferred music
- ✅ **Privacy**: No external dependencies
- ✅ **Quality**: Full control over audio quality

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

If audio doesn't play:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file names match exactly
3. Ensure files are in MP3 format
4. Check file size (should be under 10MB)
5. Try a different browser

## 📱 Testing:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the Meditation page
3. Enable music and start a session
4. Your custom audio should play!
